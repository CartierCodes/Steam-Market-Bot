# Market-Bot

This bot was made to scrape data from the Steam Marketplace and compare that data to entries made with target prices and item "float" values. The will iterate through all of the desired items and check the real-time prices of the items with "float" values within the specified in the itemData.json file. If it finds an item which fits all the criteria then it will message the user linked to who requested the item on discord with the link to the item's page on the store in order for them to buy it as fast as possible.
